## TL;DR
Embedded system developer with strong hardware background.

## Embedded
I've been always excited about how the technology works, and how it could solve daily problems. I've started with simple electronic circuits., remember my first device car battery level meter, just a few components make life easier and give me a lot of fun.

I always ask myself how low-level things work. These questions led me to technical college and after that to the Gda≈Ñsk university of technology, where I understand the atomic level of the electronic world and discover a new approach for problem-solving - programming, which gives even more possibilities.

# Hardware
For me programming is always bound with hardware, even I use a powerful device with a lot of resources I think about controlling hardware, manage its resources. This is a standard approach for embedded systems, where a good understating of electronics is a must (bare-metal programming or real-time operating systems). But sometimes this knowledge or methodology is useful in i.e. DSP programming on PC, which I'm a big fan of (audio programming, Virtual Analog modeling).

# Programming
On another side, I'm excited about how high-level technologies could be integrated with hardware, like IoT. These days hardware with Rest API becomes a standard. This approach gives a powerful tool for non-low-level programmers to control hardware in a web app's manner. I use these technologies for fast prototyping new ideas.

# Attitude
I don't like routine so my domain is discovering, problem-solving, and working with enthusiastic people in a creative atmosphere. I've been working on research projects since I can remember. So a wide range of skills was needed. These works were based on IoT, nuclear physics, robotics, and more. Always I looking forward to taking advantage of my potential for problem-solving and making new things, where wider skills are needed. I'm focused on embedded systems programming, high-efficiency programming on PC, prototype designing (HW, FW, SW), PoC's designing in research teams when electronics meets a wide range of programming levels.
